#PURPOSE
***

<b>Simulating ethical dilemmas in the laboratory setting</b>       
WE BELIEVE BETTER ETHICAL DECISCION-MAKING COMES WITH PRACTICE      

To that end, we are building an ethical simulation engine that will allow users to explore the difficult process of decision-making 
when faced with an ethical dilemma. We are keenly interested in highlighting the human element, in order to make students 
and professionals aware of the impact they might have on others in such situations.
